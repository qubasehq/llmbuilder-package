# Simple Guide: Using llmbuilder (No Tech Jargon)

This guide explains how to use llmbuilder in very simple steps.
You only need Windows and Python installed.

## What does this do?

- It turns your documents (text/PDF/Word) into a small local AI model.
- You can ask it to write text or continue a sentence.
- Everything runs on your own computer.

## What you need

- Windows PC
- Python 3.9 or newer (download from python.org)

## Step 1 — Open the folder

1) Download or open the `llmbuilder_package` folder.
2) Right‑click inside the folder and choose “Open in Terminal” (or open PowerShell here).

## Step 2 — Set up (one‑time)

Copy and paste these commands, one by one:

1) Make a safe Python space (virtual environment):

```
python -m venv venv
```

2) Turn it on:

```
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3) Install the needed packages (works on most PCs):

```
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
pip install -e .
```

If an error appears, close the window and open it again. Then try step 2 and 3 again.

## Step 3 — Prepare your files

1) Create a folder: `data/raw`
2) Put your files in it (text/PDF/Word). Start small (5–10 files).
3) Turn them into one clean text file:

```
llmbuilder data preprocess -i .\data\raw -o .\data\clean.txt
```

## Step 4 — Make a tokenizer

This helps the model read text:

```
llmbuilder data tokenizer -i .\data\clean.txt -o .\tokenizers --vocab-size 16000
```

## Step 5 — Train a small model

This teaches the model from your text. It can take some time.

```
llmbuilder train model -d .\data\clean.txt -t .\tokenizers -o .\checkpoints
```

Tip: You can stop anytime with Ctrl + C. Try with fewer files if it’s slow.

## Step 6 — Try it

Start interactive text generation:

```
llmbuilder generate text --setup
```

Follow the on‑screen steps to pick your model and tokenizer.

## Where are my files?

- Clean text: `data/clean.txt`
- Tokenizer: `tokenizers/`
- Trained model: `checkpoints/`

## Quick fixes

- “llmbuilder is not recognized” → Close and reopen PowerShell, then run `pip install -e .` again.
- “No module named torch” → Run: `pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`
- “Permission denied” on venv → Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass`, then activate venv again.
- Too slow → Use fewer files, or stop with Ctrl + C.
