```python
config.training.batch_size = 4  # or even 2
```

2. **Enable gradient checkpointing**:
```python
config.model.gradient_checkpointing = True
```

3. **Use gradient accumulation**:
```python
config.training.gradient_accumulation_steps = 4
```

4. **Reduce sequence length**:
```python
config.model.max_seq_length = 512
```

5. **Use CPU training**:
```python
config.system.device = "cpu"
```

### Q: My model isn't learning (loss not decreasing). What's wrong?

**A:** Common causes and solutions:

1. **Learning rate too high**: Reduce to 1e-4 or 1e-5
2. **Learning rate too low**: Increase to 3e-4 or 5e-4
3. **Bad data**: Check for corrupted or repetitive text
4. **Wrong tokenizer**: Ensure vocab_size matches tokenizer
5. **Insufficient warmup**: Increase warmup_steps to 1000+

### Q: How do I know if my model is overfitting?

**A:** Signs of overfitting:
- Training loss decreases but validation loss increases
- Generated text is repetitive or memorized
- Model performs poorly on new data

**Solutions:**
- Increase dropout rate (0.1 → 0.2)
- Add weight decay (0.01)
- Use early stopping
- Get more training data
- Reduce model size

## 🎯 Text Generation

### Q: How do I improve generation quality?

**A:** Try these techniques:

1. **Adjust temperature**:
   - Lower (0.3-0.7): More focused, predictable
   - Higher (0.8-1.2): More creative, diverse

2. **Use nucleus sampling**:
```python
config = GenerationConfig(
    temperature=0.8,
    top_p=0.9,      # Nucleus sampling
    top_k=50        # Top-k sampling
)
```

3. **Add repetition penalty**:
```python
config.repetition_penalty = 1.1
```

4. **Better prompts**:
   - Be specific and clear
   - Provide context and examples
   - Use consistent formatting

### Q: Why is my generated text repetitive?

**A:** Common causes and fixes:

1. **Insufficient training**: Train for more epochs
2. **Poor sampling**: Use top-p/top-k sampling instead of greedy
3. **Low temperature**: Increase temperature to 0.8+
4. **Add repetition penalty**: Set to 1.1-1.3
5. **Prevent n-gram repetition**: Set `no_repeat_ngram_size=3`

### Q: How do I make generation faster?

**A:** Speed optimization techniques:

1. **Use GPU**: Much faster than CPU
2. **Reduce max_tokens**: Generate shorter responses
3. **Use greedy decoding**: Set `do_sample=False`
4. **Enable model compilation**: Set `compile=True` (PyTorch 2.0+)
5. **Quantize model**: Use 8-bit or 16-bit precision

## 🔄 Fine-tuning

### Q: When should I fine-tune vs. train from scratch?

**A:** 
- **Fine-tune when**: You have a pre-trained model and domain-specific data
- **Train from scratch when**: You have lots of data and need full control
- **Fine-tuning advantages**: Faster, less data needed, preserves general knowledge
- **Training advantages**: Full customization, no dependency on base model

### Q: What's the difference between LoRA and full fine-tuning?

**A:**

| Aspect | LoRA | Full Fine-tuning |
|--------|------|------------------|
| **Memory** | Low (~1% of params) | High (all params) |
| **Speed** | Fast | Slower |
| **Quality** | Good for most tasks | Best possible |
| **Flexibility** | Limited adaptation | Full adaptation |
| **Use case** | Domain adaptation | Major architecture changes |

### Q: How do I prevent catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning?

**A:** Use these techniques:

1. **Lower learning rate**: 1e-5 to 5e-5
2. **Fewer epochs**: 3-5 epochs usually sufficient
3. **Regularization**: Add weight decay (0.01)
